## The possible scores of a [HitObject]:
## 0 (ACCURATE): 300 points and 100% accuracy. Applies to all [HitObject]s.
## 1 (INACCURATE): 150 points and 50% accuracy. Applies to all [HitObject]s.
## 2 (MISS): 0 points and 0% accuracy. Applies to all [HitObject]s.
## 3 (FINISHER): 300 additional points. Does not affect accuracy. Only applies to [Note]s.
## 4 (ROLL): 300 points. Does not affect accuracy. Only applies to [Roll]s.
## 5 (SPINNER): 600 points. Does not affect accuracy. Only applies to [Spinner]s.
enum Score {ACCURATE, INACCURATE, MISS, FINISHER, ROLL, SPINNER}

## The possible states of a [HitObject]:
## 0: This [HitObject]'s properties can be changed.
## 1 (READY): This [HitObject] has been loaded into the scene. Its properties can no longer be changed.
## 2 (ACTIVE): This [HitObject] has been activated and can receive [method hit] and [method miss_check] calls.
## 3 (FINISHED): This [HitObject] has been fully hit or missed. It will be disposed of once all animations finish.
